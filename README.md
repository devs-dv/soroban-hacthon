# Decentralized Energy Trading

## Project Name
Decentralized Energy Trading

## Developer
- Divyanshu Verma
- Mohd Moshin

## Comprehensive Description Of Your Project
The Decentralized Energy Trading project aims to empower individuals with solar panels to sell excess energy directly to their neighbors. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, this platform automates the process of energy trading, distribution, and billing based on energy usage data. It eliminates the need for intermediaries and provides a transparent, efficient, and decentralized marketplace for energy exchange.

## Vision
Our vision is to create a sustainable and equitable energy ecosystem where individuals can actively participate in energy trading, promote renewable energy adoption, and contribute to building a cleaner environment. By facilitating peer-to-peer energy transactions, we aim to democratize the energy market and empower individuals to take control of their energy production and consumption.
